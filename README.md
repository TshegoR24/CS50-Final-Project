FINAL PROJECT FOR CS50X COMPUTER SCIENCE.

https://youtu.be/zi_BNPucXeE

This is my final project for the CS50X Havard course. In this project I have built a web application. This wed application is a calculator. This web application is a digital simulation of a real calculator and has all if not most of the features found on a physical scientific calculator. With a few clicks using your mouse you will be able to solve a wide range of mathematical problems you might have.
The calculator can pretty much do every type of sum from additon, subtraction, multiplication, division and as well greater than and percentages.


KEY FEATURES:
⦁	Basic functions and exponents: Calculate basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
⦁	Lagorithms: Like logarithms, this calculation once took a while to solve as you went through one piece of paper after the next. 
⦁	Exponential: Exponential functions and roots beyond the square root; Quick access to constants such as pi and e. 
⦁	Memory:  They also often have multi-line display, memory functions, and the ability to perform calculations using scientific notation
⦁	Scientific notation: Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers that are too large or too small to be conveniently written in decimal form, since to do so would require writing out an inconveniently long string of digits


The Final project architecture has the following:
main.css- the simple design thats on the web application calculator is made up in here in this file.
main.js- the functions and all sums its able to do are done in this file. 
index.html - this is all the text on the application. The numbers and signs that you see on the application were all  made in this file.

FRONTEND/ USER SIDE

index.html- this is the main set up of the web application and cosists of all the extentions within the application.
main.css- this is the main set up to how the application was designed and how it will look.
main.js- is how the application operates.

More Features:
⦁	Standard Calculator functionality which offers basic operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.
⦁	Scientific Calculator functionality which offers expanded operations and evaluates commands using order of operations.
⦁	Programmer Calculator functionality which offers common mathematical operations for developers including conversion between common bases.
⦁	Date Calculation functionality which offers the difference between two dates, as well as the ability to add/subtract years, months and/or days to/from a given input date.
⦁	Calculation history and memory capabilities.
