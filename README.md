FINAL PROJECT FOR CS50X COMPUTER SCIENCE.

This is my final project for the CS50X Havard course. In this project I have built a web application. This wed application is a calculator. This web application is a digital simulation of a real calculator and has all if not most of the features found on a physical scientific calculator. With a few clicks using your mouse you will be able to solve a wide range of mathematical problems you might have.
The calculator can pretty much do every type of sum from additon, subtraction, multiplication, division and as well greater than and percentages.

The Final project architecture has the followng:
main.css
main.js
index.html

FRONTEND/ USER SIDE

index.html- this is the main set up of the web application and cosists of all the extentions within the application.
main.css- this is the main set up to how the application was designed and how it will look.
